# ESP32 Blink led it's self

Here’s a simple test program for the ESP32 to blink an LED. This is often the "Hello World" of embedded programming.

### Setup

1. Connect an LED to pin **GPIO2** (usually labeled as D2).
2. Ensure the shorter leg of the LED is connected to ground (GND) via a resistor (e.g., 220Ω).

### Code

Here's the Arduino IDE code for testing:

```cpp
// LED Blink Test for ESP32

// Define the LED pin
const int ledPin = 2; // GPIO2 (adjust if needed for your setup)

void setup() {
  // Initialize the LED pin as an output
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Turn the LED on
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1 second

  // Turn the LED off
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1 second
}
```

### Steps to Test

1. **Install ESP32 Board Package**:

   - Open Arduino IDE.
   - Go to **File > Preferences**.
   - Add this URL to the "Additional Board Manager URLs":
     ```
     https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
     ```
   - Go to **Tools > Board > Boards Manager**, search for "ESP32," and install it.

2. **Select Board and Port**:

   - Go to **Tools > Board** and select your ESP32 model (e.g., "ESP32 Dev Module").
   - Select the appropriate port under **Tools > Port**.

3. **Upload the Code**:
   - Connect your ESP32 to your computer via USB.
   - Click the upload button in the Arduino IDE.
   - If you encounter any issues, press and hold the **BOOT** button on the ESP32 while uploading.

### Expected Result

The LED connected to GPIO2 should blink on and off every second.
